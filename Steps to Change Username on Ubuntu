Steps to Change Username on Ubuntu:

1. Log in as a Different User

You cannot change the username while logged in as that user. Log in as a different user with sudo privileges 
(e.g., root or another administrative user). If you only have one user, you may need to use a Live USB or boot 
into single-user mode to make these changes.

2. Open a Terminal

Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the terminal.

3. Check the Current Username

First, verify the current username by running:

bash

Copy code

whoami

4. Rename the Username

Use the usermod command to rename the user. Replace newusername with the new username and oldusername with the current username:

bash

Copy code

sudo usermod -l newusername oldusername

This command changes the login name (username).

5. Rename the User’s Home Directory

The user’s home directory is usually named after the old username. You'll want to rename it as well:

bash

Copy code

sudo mv /home/oldusername /home/newusername

6. Update the User Group Name (if needed)

In many cases, the user’s primary group will have the same name as the username. You can rename the group with:

bash

Copy code

sudo groupmod -n newusername oldusername

7. Update File Ownership

After renaming the username and group, you should update the ownership of files in the user’s home directory. 
This ensures that the new username has full control over its files:

bash

Copy code

sudo chown -R newusername:newusername /home/newusername

8. Edit Configuration Files (if needed)

Some system files may reference the old username. You will need to manually update those. Common files that may 
need editing include:

/etc/sudoers (use sudo visudo to edit)

Any cron jobs or scripts that refer to the old username.

You can edit files like /etc/sudoers using:

bash

Copy code

sudo visudo

9. Reboot the System

After completing all the steps, reboot the system to ensure all changes are applied correctly:

bash

Copy code

sudo reboot

Important Notes:

Backup Your Data: Before making any changes to user accounts, it's always a good idea to back up important files to avoid 
data loss in case of errors.

System Services: Some system services or applications might still reference the old username, so ensure that everything is 
updated, including directories and files in /etc.

Check Permissions: After making these changes, double-check that all files, directories, and configurations are still properly 
accessible.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully change the username in Ubuntu.
