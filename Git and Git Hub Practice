Git:
Git is a version control system that helps developers track and manage changes to their codebase.
It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work, keeps 
a history of all changes, and enables collaboration.


GitHub:
GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a cloud-based environment 
for developers to store and share their Git repositories. It is built around Git, but it adds additional 
features, making collaboration easier, especially for open-source projects. GitHub helps developers.


how to create a local Repo :- 

1)open visual code and locate the path where you want to place your scripting

2) after choosing the path create a script file with a " .sh " extension which 
indicates it is a script file 

3) start the script with #!/bin/bash --- it is called a shebang (or hashbang) and 
is typically found at the beginning of a script file, especially in Bash scripts.

4) write the script and save it

example : 
#!/bin/bash 
echo "hello world" 

5) After that open git bash and use following commands 

 ---> cd <choose the folder where the script file located>

 ----> git init .    ---> it it create a empty local repo

----> git status   ----> to check whether files are in staged state or unstaged state

-----> git add <file name>   ---> to add the file to the staged state

-----> git commit -m "changed made in the script" <file name>    ---> to notify the changes made in the script

----> chmod +x <file name>  ---> provide the execute permissions to the file

----- > git push origin main   ---> to push the file to the central repo

----> First time it will ask permission to access github, for that create a token in github and paste the token  

Note :- Providing user name and password is not recommened in real life scenario so instead using token  

6) now connect to the ec2 instance and clone the script to the server.

----> ssh ec2-user@<server ip>

----> sudo su - 

-----> git pull <github url>

------> ls 

------> chmod +x <file name>  ---> provide the execute permissions to the file

----> ./<file name> or bash <file name>

output :- hello world
